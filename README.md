I just want to create my vision of an amazing game. I envision it as something of a cross, gameplay-wise, between an Elder Scrolls and a Dark Souls game (in-depth characters, open world exploration, challenging gameplay, etc.).
Perhaps I'm being too ambitious, but I plan to create a few games before going forward with this vision.
